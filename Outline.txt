Great choice! A Travel Cost Optimizer is a practical and fun project that combines API integration, optimization techniques, and data visualization. Hereâ€™s a plan to help you get started:

---

### **Project Outline**
#### 1. **Define Objectives**
   - Minimize total travel cost (flights, accommodation, transport).
   - Allow users to input cities, travel dates, and preferences (e.g., budget, preferred modes of transport).
   - Provide an optimized itinerary with costs and routes.

---

#### 2. **Data Sources**
   - **Flight Data**: Skyscanner API, Amadeus Travel APIs, or Kayak API.
   - **Accommodation Data**: Booking.com API or Airbnb data (if accessible).
   - **Transport Data**: Google Maps API for local transport and driving routes.
   - **Currency Conversion**: Exchange rate APIs like Open Exchange Rates.

---

#### 3. **Core Components**
   1. **User Interface** (optional to start)
      - A web app using Flask/Django (Python) or a desktop app with a simple CLI.
   2. **Data Collection**
      - Use API calls to fetch travel, accommodation, and transport data.
   3. **Cost Optimization**
      - Implement algorithms like:
        - **Greedy algorithms** for quick and simple solutions.
        - **Dynamic programming** for optimizing complex routes.
        - **Genetic algorithms** for larger search spaces.
   4. **Visualization**
      - Plot routes and costs using libraries like Folium, Plotly, or Matplotlib.

---

#### 4. **Technical Stack**
   - **Programming Language**: Python (preferred for APIs, optimization, and visualization).
   - **Libraries**:
     - `requests` for API calls.
     - `NumPy` and `Pandas` for data manipulation.
     - `Scikit-learn` or `Google OR-Tools` for optimization.
     - `Folium` or `Plotly` for mapping and visualization.
   - **Database**: SQLite or PostgreSQL for storing user inputs and API responses.

---

#### 5. **Development Phases**
   - **Phase 1**: Basic route optimization for two cities using dummy data.
   - **Phase 2**: Integrate API to fetch real-world data.
   - **Phase 3**: Expand to multi-city trips with constraints like time and budget.
   - **Phase 4**: Add a user interface and advanced features like travel alerts.

---

#### 6. **Challenges**
   - Handling API rate limits and authentication.
   - Combining various cost components (e.g., flights + hotels) into a unified system.
   - Optimizing for multiple criteria (cost, travel time, preferences).
